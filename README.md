# TDSP_Motor_Collisions

The purpose of this project is to analyze the higher concentration of Crashes with Injuries observed in the entry points into Manhattan. This project and visual poster is aimed to advice commuters to be safe during their travel home. This is also to make city officials aware that something should be done to make the streets safer for the commuters of New York.

As of January 2025, New York City has implemented Congestion Pricing Tolls to the entrances of Lower and Mid Town Manhattan. Therefore, over the course of a year or more, further analysis on crashes should be made to determine if the city's decision for congestion pricing actually makes a difference in this matter.
